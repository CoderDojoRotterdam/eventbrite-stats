# Eventbrite Stats

We thought it would be nice to look at CoderDojo Rotterdam (SF) in numbers and stats for 2016 as a sort of 'Year in Review' since all the cool companies are doing that these days :)
Sure we could have counted it manually.. Sure we could have downloaded all the CSV exports from EventBrite and fiddle around in Excel..

But where's the fun in that? Better pick a language we didn't touch in years and start coding ðŸ¤”

## Using this for your Dojo
Obviously you can! Here's how:

1. Download the reports from all Dojo's from EventBrite (Save as CSV)
2. Place the CSV files in the `data` directory
3. Run `python main.py`

**Huge disclaimer:** This might need a little fiddling around with keynames since EventBrite exports all fields as the literal questions.
